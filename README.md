Rock Paper Scissors project. Currently just in console but will have GUI soon. 
Date and time started: 19/09/2021, 12:00 
Date and time completed: 20/09/21 aproximately 7 hours of work 

Lessons learned from console version. This project has really helped me understand functions especially invoking functions within others, and the usefulness of local variables. This was also a good exercise in problem solving as I broke the problem down into component parts. I also got good practice with string methods, array methods, template literals, concatenation, understanding variables, and returning values with functions.
