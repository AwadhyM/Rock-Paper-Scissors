Rock Paper Scissors project.
Console version
Date and time started: 19/09/2021, 12:00 
Date and time completed: 20/09/21 aproximately 7 hours of work 

Lessons learned from console version. This project has really helped me understand functions especially invoking functions within others, and the usefulness of local variables. This was also a good exercise in problem solving as I broke the problem down into component parts. I also got good practice with string methods, array methods, template literals, concatenation, understanding variables, and returning values with functions.

Added GUI to this project. Learnt how to create and use branches on git version control. Also how to add and remove event listners with named functions, and how to manipulate the DOM. 

Have also realised that I need to work on the quality of my git commits and if I am pushing to branch (I think I am doing it too frequently).
